# password-generator

## JavaScript
I left the html and css completely untouched, but I did ofcourse add some code to the JavaScript file. I added some variaibles, and functions along with a for loop to help complete this process. 

## Projects
I was able to generate a full functional randomized password generator that will prompt a length anywhere from 8 - 128 characters of your choice. It will include numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. If you choose to go under 8, or over 128, then it'll prompt an error message. You can generate as many as you'd like.
